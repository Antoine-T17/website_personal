**From raw data to live, interactive visualization.**

# Introduction

The ZebraBox chamber is a complete system for high-throughput behavioral tests. Applications include pharmacology, toxicology, ecotoxicology, and behavioral genetics. The device holds 6-, 12-, 24-, 48- or 96-well plates and has a high-resolution camera which films in visible or infrared light. Tests run from minutes to days and each data point links to a fixed time window (integration period). Output files are `.raw` and `.xls`.

# Why This App?

Data in many files and formats leads to errors, duplicates, and manual fixes. This app centralizes everything in one place. You get accurate, up-to-date, and auditable results without code. <br>

**Simple : drag, drop, clean, merge, and analyze in a few clicks.**

# How to Use the App ?

## Get the app

Coming soon...

## Load or Create a Plate Plan

ZebraBox uses standard multi-well plates. Edge wells can show border effects. The app can generate a random plan. Download it as `.xlsx` or view it as a table and figure. If you already have a plan, load it and wait to see *Upload complete* to click on the button. Column names must follow the required format. *What is a required format ?* Click [here](inputs/sample_plate_plan_plate_1.xlsx) to download a 96-well sample plate plan.

## Load Raw Data

Raw files must be in `.xlsx`. Convert your original `.xls` files before loading. When loading, wait to see *Upload complete* to click on the button. The number of raw files must match your plate plans.

## Choose Primary Mode

-   **Tracking mode**\
    Follows each subject’s path.\
    Yields distance moved, active time, and movement counts.\
    See details in the [ZebraBox guide](inputs/zebrabox_guidelines.pdf).

-   **Quantization mode**\
    Counts pixel color changes.\
    Yields high, medium, or low activity levels.\
    See details in the [ZebraBox guide](inputs/zebrabox_guidelines.pdf).

## Choose Secondary Mode

-   **Light/Dark (LDM)**\
    For experiments with light shifts (0–100% or 100–0%).\
    Works even if no change occurred.

-   **Vibration/Rest (VM)**\
    For experiments with vibration frequencies (Hz).
