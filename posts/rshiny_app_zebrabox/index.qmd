**From raw data to interactive visualization.**

# Introduction

The ZebraBox chamber is a complete system for high-throughput behavioral tests. Applications include pharmacology, toxicology, ecotoxicology, and behavioral genetics. The device holds 6-, 12-, 24-, 48- or 96-well plates and has a high-resolution camera which films in visible or infrared light. Tests run from minutes to days and each data point links to a fixed time window (integration period). Output files are `.raw` and `.xls`.

# Why This App?

Data in many files and formats leads to errors, duplicates, and manual fixes. This app centralizes everything in one place. You get accurate, up-to-date, and auditable results without code. <br>

# How to Use the App ?

## Get the app

Coming soon...

## Load or Create a Plate Plan

ZebraBox uses standard multi-well plates. Edge wells can show border effects. The app can generate a random plan. Download it as `.xlsx` or view it as a table and figure. If you already have a plan, load it and wait to see *Upload complete* to click on the button. Column names must follow the required format. *What is the required format?* Download a [96-well sample plate plan](inputs/sample_plate_plan_plate_1.xlsx).

## Load Raw Data

Raw files must be in `.xlsx`. Convert your original `.xls` files before loading. When loading, wait to see *Upload complete* to click on the button.

:::{ .warnings}
The number of raw files must match your plate plans.
:::

## Choose Primary Mode

-   **Tracking mode**\
    Follows each subject’s path.\
    Yields distance moved, active time, and movement counts.\
    See details in the [ZebraBox guide](inputs/zebrabox_guidelines.pdf).

-   **Quantization mode**\
    Counts pixel color changes.\
    Yields high, medium, or low activity levels.\
    See details in the [ZebraBox guide](inputs/zebrabox_guidelines.pdf).

## Choose Secondary Mode

-   **Light/Dark (LDM)**\
    For experiments with light shifts (0–100% or 100–0%).\
    Works even if no change occurred.

-   **Vibration/Rest (VM)**\
    For experiments with vibration frequencies (Hz).

# Processing Data

## Match Raw Data to Plate Plans

Confirm that each raw data file is correctly paired with its corresponding plate plan. Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate plate plan.

## Additional Parameters

Before running full processing, upload your period transition file and removal specification file. Both must be `.xlsx` files with column names in the required format. *What is the required format?* Download a [sample period transition file](inputs/sample_period_transition.xlsx) and a [sample removal specification file](inputs/sample_removal_specification.xlsx).

## Run Full Processing

After you start processing, follow each step in the *Console Output*. When it finishes, explore results in the *Processed Data* tab or download them for external analysis.

# Visualize Data

Choose a plot type and generate the dataset. Check the *Console Output* to confirm the generation completed successfully. The *Visualization* tab is designed for quick data exploration. For deeper customization, download the processed data or the generated plot datasets.

You can configure and export figures with:

- **Export formats:** HTML (interactive) or PNG (static)  
- **Theme:** light or dark  
- **Zone selection:** restrict to specific zones (if applicable)  
- **X-axis label order:** define a custom order  
- **Label color:** set category/condition colors  
- **Save options:** export each figure as HTML or PNG

## Boxplots

Visualize distributions across transition periods (e.g., Light/Dark or Vibration/Rest).

## Cumulative Boxplots

View overall distributions independent of transition periods.

## Delta Boxplots

Compare values **before**, **during**, and **after** a selected transition period to pinpoint responses (e.g., escape/avoidance) to stimuli.

## Line Plots

Track activity or movement patterns over time to reveal trends and temporal dynamics.

## Radar Plots

Get a global overview of multiple response variables across experimental conditions.
